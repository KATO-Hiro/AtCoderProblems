## Glossary
- Difficulty
  - This value indicates that a person with the current internal rating (unadjusted rating) would have a 50% chance of solving the problem in a contest.
  - There are problems with a test tube emoji (ðŸ§ª) next to the estimated difficulty. This indicates that the difficulty was estimated using somewhat forceful methods for problems before the official rating system was introduced.
  - A problem with a Difficulty of X means "half of the people with a rating of X can solve this problem," not "everyone with a rating of X can solve this problem."

- Streak
  - The number of consecutive days you have solved new problems that you haven't solved before.
  - Longest Streak is calculated based on JST, while Current Streak is calculated based on Local Time.
  - Solving a problem that you have solved before will not increase the Streak count.
