# Finding Problems
You can search for problems based on the following criteria:
1. Filter by AC/non-AC
1. Filter by AtCoder official score
1. Filter by difficulty calculated independently
1. Search by problem title, contest name, FA user, fastest user, etc.

## How to Search for Problems
1. Enter your AtCoder ID in the User ID field at the top left of the page, and select `List` at the top of the page.
1. By selecting the items under Problem List, you can filter problems based on AC/non-AC, AtCoder official score, and difficulty.
1. If you know the problem's name or want to search based on Fastest (shortest execution time), Shortest (shortest code length), or First (fastest submission time) users, you can enter the problem name or user name into the `Search` field on the right.
