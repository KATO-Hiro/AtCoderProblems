- Tips for Creating a Virtual Contest
  - Bacha Gacha
    - This feature randomly selects problems when you specify a range of difficulty.
    - If you enter the AtCoder IDs of expected participants in the Expected Participants field and specify Exclude ~~~, problems that participants have already solved will be excluded. This is recommended to ensure fairness.
  - Mode
    - There are three types: Normal, Lockout, and Training.
    - Normal is the standard mode. Participants are ranked based on their total score and penalties.
    - In Lockout mode, only the first person to solve each problem gets the points.
    - In Training mode, the scoreboard display is simplified. This mode is recommended when there are many problems. Participants are ranked based on the total number of problems solved and the time of the last correct submission.
